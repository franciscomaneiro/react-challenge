<h2 align="center">Challenge ReactJS</h2>

## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The project is set up with a basic architecture so you can focus into the most important features.

## What we expect on this challenge:
- Features:
  - [x] Transcribe all components, than you find, from classes to functional in the Components folder.
  - [x] Implement a CR to handle **C**reate and **R**ead users persisting them into **Local Storage**.
  - [x] We wish you to identify component issues that are not well designed, and improve their reusability

The CRUD have to follow these requirements:
- [x] Must persist data with refresh (Local storage as mentioned above).
- [x] Apply a State manager to handle the basic features (Mobx, Redux, Reflux, ContextAPI - Where you feel confortable, we wish to understand how you structure your logic)
- [x] Validate and show input errors to prevent form submitting 

You can add any library into the project, but we wish to evaluate how you create your own components

Not required but desireable:
- [x] Jest knowledge, fix component errors.
- [x] Any performance improvement, avoid multiple renders.
- [x] Implement a DU to handle **D**elete and **U**pdate users persisting them into **Local Storage**.
- [x] Design System improvements
- [x] Implement TS
- [ ] Deploy the challenge (Heroku, AWS)
